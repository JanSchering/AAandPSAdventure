# Bugs that need fixing

1. some items can be picked up infinitely, e.g. the sword in the hallway
PARTLY FIXED - it will recognize when it is done and print "You have already picked that up"
So mostly just need to adjust the phrasing used around pick up actions to make it more natural
Maybe "you go to pick up the sword" or something

2. Reading it is very hard on the eyes. Might need to clear screen, or indent more

3. Was unclear needed to type for name

4. Labelling of checkpoints is a bit unclear (when I click checkpoint 0 I don't know what to expect)
FIXED - just keep it in mind as filling in new stuff

5. Prompting to use arrow keys mabe just a one time thing? Looks a bit awkward

6. Currently we have a limited number of save files you can make, easy to get rid of restriction though if we decide that's better. Or make higher since only 3 right now
