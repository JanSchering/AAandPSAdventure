# Bugs that need fixing

1. some items can be picked up infinitely, e.g. the sword in the hallway

2. Reading it is very hard on the eyes. Might need to clear screen, or indent more

3. Was unclear needed to type for name

4. Labelling of checkpoints is a bit unclear (when I click checkpoint 0 I don't know what to expect)

5. Prompting to use arrow keys mabe just a one time thing? Looks a bit awkward
