You see their parents and the two children. The father cradles a swaddled baby, which the mother regards with a hint of a scorn. Standing suits of armor flank wooden walls in the east and west walls. Each suit of armor clutches a spear and has a visored helm shaped like a wolf's head. The walls are carved with dancing children. At one end of the hallway is a red marble staircase, and at the other end is a way to go to the hunter's den. You also notice a trapdoor in the floor.",
